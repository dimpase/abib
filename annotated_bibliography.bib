					\smallskip \\ This paper develops a taxonomy of explanation in mathematics in based on data from the minipolymath projects. Since online blogs and forums are quite conducive to quantitative and empirical research, the authors develop paricular indicators to test their hypotheses. The first hypothesis to be rejected is the assertion that ``there are no explanations in mathematics.'' The hypothesis, on the contrary, that ``all explanations are answers to why-questions'' was found to be strongly supported by evidence. The authors, then, go into more detail, as to the eplanations themselves: these have been found to be \textit{trace explanations}, that is, explanations that point to the sequence of inferences that led to the conclusion, as well as \textit{strategic explanations}, that is, explanations that demonstrate the solving strategy. An important aspect of explanations in mathematics is the sociality factor. Here the authors demontstrate that explanations are related to the following people-centred elements: abilities; knowledge; understanding; values. Moreover, the social context involved in explanations is, as well, varied: inquiry; pedagogical; persuasion; information-seeking."

The authors distinguish \textit{unilateral epistemic dependence}, i.e. when an individual scientist trusts the testimony/testimonies of other scientists, with whom he or she is not necessary collaborating; and \textit{multilateral epistemic dependence}, i.e. when a group of collaborating scientists trust each others' scientific testimonies in order to continue with their research activities. In a research collaboration group, in other words, there is complementary knowledge distributed among the individual members of the group. The the authors raise the question of how to \textit{integrate} the group's distributed knowledge in an optimal way. The problem arises due to the fact that each member can have \textit{interactional expertise} on the fields of his or her fellow researchers. i.e. has a superficial knowledge of the subject that helps him or her to discuss subjects outside his or her field, but \textit{contributory expertise} only on his or her own field, i.e. can deep knowledge of the subject and can produce new knowledge. The authors propose for different ways of \textit{cognitive integration} within the group, depending on the type of epistemic dependence and the type of expertise distributed among the research group members. In the case of unilateral, or bilateral, epistemic dependence, integration can be done by the group leader, who possesses the ``full expertise'' to connect with each group member. When each member has only limited interactional expertise of areas beyond his or her own, then the members form a group of multilateral epistemic dependence to teach each other, and at the end the group may dissolve. When there is an overlap of expertise between group members, again a case of multilateral epistemic dependence, usually the case is one of \textit{negotiation among experts}. And finally, in the case that each member has a substantial level of interactional expertise in the areas of his or her collaborators, then, according to the authors, this will be a case of \textit{joint integration}."

A blog was already a familiar form of online practice for many participants before the announcement of polymath. In the beginning there was much of reflective thinking about the blog, and the author describes how the blog evolved through collective self-observation. Probably the most important aspect in the experience of reading a blog is its temporal presentation of discussion threads. That posed a problem in following sub-threads of discussions, since everything was presented in a linear narrative. Gowers's role, the originator and administrator of the blog, was pivotal on this: he activated the threaded comments feature of the blog, and threads could now branch into sub-threads presented again in a temporal way. Another important factor was the \LaTeX\ typeset feature, part of the modern common culture of every the mathematician all over the world. Another feature of the blog platform was the ability to use \LaTeX\ markup, although this had to be adapted to the new blog environment: many users not acquainted with the particularities of \LaTeX\ on the blog platform quite often made mistakes in their postings, and commented on them."

It is an ethnographic study of mathematics as a laboratory, rather, than as a science proper. Blackboards are mainly found in seminar rooms and lecture theatres: they define the audience's orientation and mark the visual territory of the lecture. Blackboards can be big, or small, and available; slow, and loud; common and ostentatious. Blackboards define the performance accompanying writing with chalk; they become a theatrical prop, or a scene backdrop. The lecturer can erase by hand a formula, putting a semicolon on the performance; he, or she, on the other hand can erase the whole surface, putting a full stop, or changing a paragraph, on the proving performance. The chalk's shape, on the other hand, limits its writing abilities with respect to certain markings, but its manual manipulation can condense or disperse complicated formulas. Chalk writing itself narrates the proof in a revealingly unfolding path uncovering bit by bit the deeper mathematical meaning. Blacboard and chalk combined on the fly can translate ``complex, symbol-intensive ideas into a manipulable, surveyable form.'' This ``blackboard'' way of writing is not limited to ``vertical'' board writing, but extends to ``horizontal'' board writing: piles and piles of paper covering a mathematician's desk. Scrap paper writing is as well, quite akin to chalk writing. The author of the paper stresses quite a few times in a rather subtle way that blackboards, chalk, and piles of scrap paper make certain types of mathematical argumentation materially more feasible than others."

Francis  Galton, the statistician who formulated, in the first place,  correlation and regrassion analysis did so out of a social interest: he believed in the possibility of eugenics and was interested in studying the variation around the mean. The use of mathematical inscriptions were equally important while Galton created  a new tier of reality: his various measurements of pea sizes, human heights, and body parts were meticulously recorded and then transformed and reshuffled on paper as he applied his statistical techniques. The correlation coefficient and the regression line emerged as new ``bits of being.'' At the same time Galton involved a whole network of allies in developing his new theory: his own money; his use of the bean machine, a device demonstrating that the normal distribution is approximate to the binomial distribution; his involvement with a number of scientists and scientific societies; and his reliance on a particular body of contemporary ideas. This netowrk of regression analysis allies was extended to include: the institutionalization of statistics; the spreas of immutable mobiles in the form of scholarly periodicals; and in the treatment both by governments and by academic disciplines of their respective subjects. Then regression analysis for similar reasons spread to the human geography studies in the 20th century. The general argument of the article, in other words, is that  that numbers are not eternal perfect forms but have very particular social and cultural biographies, and as correlation and regression analyses became black boxes, they moved out of biometrics and into other fields, including eventually human geography in the mid-1950s."

According to the author there is a generally held belief that mathematics and logic are seen as being about a body of truths which exist in their own right independently of whether anyone believes them or knows about them. The author, on the contrary, in accord to his strong programme, holds that mathematics and logic are collections of norms, and their ontological status is the same as that of a social institution. In other words, the activities of calculation and inference, in the author's opinion, are amenable to the same processes of investigation, and can be explained by the same theories, as any other body of social norms.

According to the author, Lakatos treats mathematical 'kinds' as being our creations; classification is our achievement and our problem. Lakatos, in the author's opinion, asserts that theorems are conjectures, and as such they need testing; and proofs are attempts to test them. A proof procedure does not have a set of preordained implications outside the immediate context of use: it begins with an invention of a technique or procedure, a process which can be repeated a finite number of steps. Still, though, simple ideas can always be turned into complex ones and the whole problem started again. In this way mathematical concepts can be `stretched,' and counterexamples are being `recognised.' The recognition of a counterexample, i.e. the renegotiation of the boundaries that circumscribe a mathematical concept, when this very concept is being negotiated is a social process, and not an absolute one. To get the whole story, in the author's opinion, we need to know if there are any general patterns in these endlessly necessary negotiations, and what the currency is in terms of which profits and losses are calculated. Then the author turns to Mary Douglas's group/grid theory: the boundary which separates the members of a social group from strangers is called simply the group boundary, and its strength is said to vary from low group to high group; while the pattern of roles and statuses is thought of as a grid of internal boundaries. The unifying idea of the group/grid theory, according to the paper, is that the response to anomaly, and hence the drawing of intellectual boundaries, will be negotiated into alignment with the pattern of social group/grid boundaries."

After their (technically demanding) analysis the authors reach some quite interesting conclusions. Both papers having three or more authors as well as researchers having three or more collaborators increased at a high rate. The authors of the paper formulate three alternative and parallel explanations of these trends. One is that as researchers become better connected, i.e. expand their collaboration network, more avenues of potential research arise, leading into an increase of contributions per paper overall. An additional explanation is that there are collaborators, not professional mathematicians themselves, who joined mathematics research groups rather infrequently. A third possible explanation, according to the paper, is that as the subnetworks of pure and applied mathematics have grown more cohesive, the overall scientific literature is becoming more cohesive. In the applied mathematics network the paper observes a surge in one-time authors, and one-time collaborations, while the pure mathematics subnetwork demonstrates greater productivity, as regards to individual researchers and collaborative pairs, as well as greater interdisciplinarity, as measured by the number of assigned subject classifications."

Five main factors were identified for this lack of trust. The first was a lack of transparency with respect to the derivation of results: the intermediate steps conducted by the system were not clear. As a result there was a lack of clearly defined operational boundaries: when the computer operates strictly on the input from the user, and when it adds its own steps? The third problem identified was the need for two-dimensional input: the systems were not conducive for researchers in moving between informal notes, sketches, mathematical formulae, and mathematical arguments. A result of this was a potential for transcription problems when switching from physical to computational media, and vice versa. A final factor was that computer systems had limited support for collaboration among experts, which is quite important, especially in the early stages of research: a shared computer console requires coordination of physical input devices, as opposed, for example, to the use of blackboard. Collaboration through physical media, on the other hand, was much easier"

		\smallskip \\ This thesis presents two qualitative ethnographic case studies of the communities that have formed around two Citizen Cyberscience projects (CCP): climateprediction.net and Galaxy Zoo. CCPs are projects mediated through the Internet, in which teams of scientists recruit members of the public (volunteers) to assist in scientific research, typically through the processing of large quantities of data. By considering these social actors in the broader contexts in which they are situated (historical, institutional, social, scientific), the author discusses the co-shaping of the interests of these actors, the nature of the relationships amongst these actors, and the infrastructure of the projects and the purposes and nature of the scientific work performed. The author focuses on two relationships in particular. The first is that between scientists and volunteers, finding that, although scientists in both projects are concerned with treating volunteers with respect, there are nevertheless considerable differences between the projects. These are related to a number of interconnecting factors, including the particular contexts in which each project is embedded, the nature of the scientific work that volunteers are asked to undertake, the possibilities and challenges for the future development of the projects as perceived by the scientists, and the tools at the disposal of the respective teams of scientists for mediating relationships with volunteers. The second is amongst the volunteers themselves. This thesis argues that volunteers are heterogeneous, from disparate backgrounds, and that they sustain their involvement in CCPs for very different purposes. In particular, they seek to pursue these through the way they negotiate and construct their relationships to other volunteers, drawing on particular features of the project to do so."

The group that built it believed that mathematical proof involved human insight which could not be automated, and what was left was to automate the parts of a proof that could be, in their opinion, automated. After the input of programmers' instructions, the results were unpredictable to a high degree, and the proofs were needed an excessive amount of time to be elicited. A first modification of their method was to put human intuition into the machine. This was done by a special module in the program, the SYSIN file. The SYSIN file read a \textit{weighted information} file compiled by the programmers, which restricted the order of inferences according to the researchers' intuition as to which inferences mattered the most. A second mechanism, the Set of Support Strategy, received input from human users which restricted the the inference sequences that AURA could make. In between all of these steps the researchers were experimenting and checking the output of these experiments, and were also building models of problems to be solved. This, in the author's opinion, demonstrates a negotiation of proof between humans and machine, a nonhuman, which was, in general, quite successful in its final results."

And while Russel and Whitehead's paper-oriented expressions had two operations for generating and manipulating expressions, magnetic-storage-oriented expressions, as implemented for example on the RAND Johnniac computer between 1955 and 1957, had 44 variations of such operations. These operations constituted a new grammar of magnetic-storage-oriented writing. Writing about computers also led to the development of new forms of writing. Such examples are Knuth's famous proposal for ``literary programming,'' as well as the many manuals, tutorials, instruction sets, and references by practitioners ``promoting'' computer skills through their pages."

The authors conducted qualitative research that consisted of in-person and phne interviews, one focus group, and observational fieldwork sessions. Digital image archives offer a zoom feature, a ruler and a colour patch to assist scholars in the analysis of a document's physical properties, such as its decorative elements, size, binding, and areas where it is deteriorated. Moreover, paleographic practices focus on the content of documents where scholars are interested in deciphering and reading words and musical notes as well as trying to identify the scribes who wrote them. The authors found that scholars required two computer monitors to compare documents archived in two different digital image archives. Another interesting finding is that some digital archives create functionality that prevents them from saving online images on to the user's desktop, thus protecting the images from being copied. In other cases, the researcher must acquire
permission from the manuscript holder to access the digital image. "

The themes around which the authors conducted their empirical research were the following: \textit{activity}, which must be approached from the organisational actor's standpoint; \textit{ownership}, that is, the motional bond that ties actors to the social artefact that they build; \textit{link}, that is, the purpose, meaning and design  as revealed in actors' (empirically detectable) relationships with various audiences; \textit{reputation}, which brings out the actors' feelings of participation in organizational life and their symbolic contribution to the social construction of organisational texture; \textit{typification} and the \textit{mirror game} --by which various groups first form images of each other and then reflect them back and forth among themselves-- are processes weaving together the organization's texture and its members' sense of belonging to it. The authors, though, acknowledge that their approach has both a strength and a weakness: it highlights those features of an organization that make it unique and special; on the other hand, it is an approach that focuses on those aspects that are least susceptible to comparison with those of other organizations."

The problem with this particular theorem is that it makes formalisation extremely difficult due to a great combination of theories involved in describing the the same mathematical object. The collaborators involved in formalising the proof had to develop many various techniques with each technique specialised for particular tasks. The authors conclude that because of the combined success of the great number of techniques involved in proving the Odd Order Theorem, the proof assistant community is now ready for ``theorem proving in the large.''"

Infrastructural rhythms are dictated by the extensive assemblage of equipment and infrastructure, such as the time of software upgrades, hardware replacement schedules, and the time it takes to build adoption of a new protocol, instrument or standard within a research group or across a field, or the time it takes for a spacecraft to get to Mars. Biographical rhythms have to do with the life choices and circumstances of scientific workers themselves, such as timing of children, illness and recovery, divorces and new relationships, births and deaths. Phenomenal rhythms are related to the rhythms emanating from the objects of study themselves: in the cases of ecology and earth studies, for example, there are the seasonal rhythms of animals mating, snow melting, and vegetation growing, budding, maturing, and declining according to distinctive and sometimes inconvenient patterns."

The authors conclude that hat constitutes a collaboration therefore varies across institutions, fields, sectors and countries, and very probably changes over time as well. Among the factors which motivate collaboration the authors cite: funding agencies' need to save money, the growing availability and falling (real) cost of transport and communication; the desire for intellectual interactions with other scientists; the need for a division of labour in more specialised or capital-intensive areas of science; the requirements of interdisciplinary research; and government encouragement of international and cross-sectoral collaboration."

The paper draws on a research program on Renato Caccioppoli, a famous Italian mathematician, and the group of mathematicians he used to work with. The author's research followed a qualitative methodology and focused on interviews and documents (letters, books, movies analysis, newspapers' articles) on historical and contemporary accounts of schools of mathematics and epistemic communities. The following practices were identified as the pragmatics of passion, i.e. the set of situated practices that sustains, supports and nurtures collective scientific passion: celebrating talent; writing argumentative papers; construction of the beauty of mathematical objects; distribution of competencies; and memory work."

During the 1990s, according to the authors, the ``eco-system'' was disturbed by changes in the political system such as the fall of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany, and during the period 2000--2005 the network of global collaborations appears, in the authors' opinion, to have reinforced the formation of a core group of fourteen most cooperative countries. The paper concludes that the order arises from rules embedded at the level of the researchers themselves, and self-organizes through collective action."

The authors conducted a web-based survey which elicited responses to a series of value statements and were analysed using the weighted average method and through cross-tabulation. The authors find strong support for communism as an academic norm defined in relation to sharing research results and teaching materials as opposed to protecting intellectual copyright and withholding accessi, but more limited support for universalism as defined by the belief that academic knowledge should transcend national, political, or religious boundaries. Disinterestedness, as defined in terms of personal detachment from truth claims, was found to be least popular contemporary academic norm, and the authors connect this finding with the  high impact of a performative culturewhich is linked to the need for a large number of academics to align their research interests with funding opportunities. The authors conclude by proposing an  alternate set of contemporary academic norms: capitalism, as a belief in maximising individual financial return on academic endeavour in a market economy; particularism, that knowledge is individually constructed on the basis of social experiences and political forces; and interestedness, closely related to the belief that academic enquiry can never be a value-free, dispassionate analysis of the observed 'facts'."

Karl Pearson, one of the founders of he emerging community of mathematical statisticians in Britain, and George Udny Yule, his best-known pupil, found themselves opposed to each other in an increasingly acrimonious debate. The underlying basis of this debate, according to the author, could be locationg on conflicting \textit{social interests}. The author defines \textit{cognitive interests} as referring to those aspects of the actual or potential scientific applications of theories which `feed back' into theoretical development by structuring scientists' construction and judgment of theories. The natural sciences typically embody cognitive interests in technical prediction and control. In providing measures of association, both Pearson and Yule were attempting to extend the scope of statistical analysis into a field where no reliable techniques of inference were available. Pearson's approach was structured by the analogy between the association of nominal variables and correlation employed as a tool for interval-level prediction. Yule's methods, on the other hand, were structured by a cognitive  interest in prediction using nominal data as phenomena in their own right; the nominal/interval analogy had for him no direct force. Their concepts of `measuring association', in the author's opinion, were different: for Pearson it meant seeking to estimate an underlying correlation; for Yule, seeking in a looser sense to measure the dependence of the given nominal data. Pearson's eugenically-oriented research programme was one in which the theories of regression,correlation and association played an important part. Yule, on the other hand, had no commitment to eugenics; although Yule's early statistical work was pauperism, considered a symptom of hereditary degeneracy by eugenics, he concentrated on the way administrative reforms, notably the abolition of out relief, reduced the observed rate of pauperism. The author suggests that two distinct constellations of interests  could be seen in the British intelligentsia in the Victorian and Edwardian period. One was grounded in the situation of those professional occupations that were growing in importance with modernization: it found expression in technocratic ideologies such as Fabianism, and in the eugenics movement; the other was grounded in the situation of those disparate members of the traditional elite (for example, downwardly-mobile offspring), to whom modernization posed a threat: this constellation of interests found expression in various forms of conservatism, but not in scientistic ideologies such as eugenics."

A second theme the paper focuses on, is mathematical proof of the correctness of programs and hardware designs demanded for systems crucial to safety or security. The author mentions the case of the VIPER microprocessor as an instance that formal proof in computer systems is, in fact, much more controversial than floating-point arithmetic. The VIPER microprocessor was funded by the UK Ministry of Defence, was intended for use in safety-critical systems. When the VIPER was commercialised the High Court was almost called upon in order to decide on whether the formal proof behind VIPER was indeed a proof or not. "

This classification is sociological, in the sense that, the demonstration of a proof can be convicing to some scientific quarters, while unconvincing to other ones. Proofs \textit{about} computers are related to the practical limitations of exhaustive software testing. In commercial computing, empirical testing, no matter how imperfect, is considered an inescapable necessity. In academic computing, on the contrary, software verification with mathematical theoretical models, that covers all possible cases, is deemed irreplaceable. Proofs \textit{using} computers, on the other hand, have to do with (machine) proof checkers, and automated theorem provers: proofs made by hand, according to the mainstream opinion in the field of computer science, are of limited use. The author, then, distinguishes between formal proof, and rigorous argument. A formal proof is a finite sequence of formulae produced by mechanised inference rules. Rigorous arguments, on the other hand are are all those arguments accepted by mathematicians as mathematical proofs, but are not necessary formal proofs. In other words, formal proofs can be machine-produced, while rigorous arguments are human-produced, but not necessarily machine-produced, and this is an instance of a disciplinary divide."

The users of statistical methods and results have an important role, as well.

The first is the \textit{polymath} project: a specially organised blog with important, and difficult to solve, mathematical problems, set up initially by the Fields medallist Timothy Gowers. The result was a journal collective publication. Later on, another key figure for later \textit{polymaths} joined the blog, the Fields medallist Terence Tao. The blog moderators encouraged participation by proposing ideas of solutions, or pointing to errors in a proposed solution step. In later \textit{polymaths} a blog leader occasionally summarised together discussion threads and sub-threads, and created new threads. One major principle behind the design of the blog was not to intimidate new participants, or hamper existing ones. There was a widespread enthusiasm among the participants due to the high-profile problems to be solved, and the sense of participation in solving it. There were concerns as to the time commitment to the project, as well as to the public visibility of errors, both especially for new researchers not established in their fields. The second case the author examines are the \textit{minipolymath} series: series of problems implementing the \textit{polymath} model drawn from the International Mathematical Olympiad. One of these problems, posted at 8am on July 19th, 2011, had been solved by 9.50pm. The author developed a typology of comments on the blog: concept, example, conjecture, proof, example \& conjecture, other. By far the most instrumental in the discussion threads were the \textit{examples}. The third case of computer software use in mathematics everyday research that the author examines is the \textit{mathoverflow} forum. In \textit{mathoverflow} users post questions on research-level mathematics, and they receive answers from other users. This forum uses, in addition, a reputation system based on ratings from the users. The author, after studying the ``group theory'' questions developed a typology of questions: conjecture, what is this, example, formula, different proof, reference, perplexed, motivation, other. About 90\% of the questions received a response. The last case the author examines is the GAP open-source software: a computer algebra system supporting research and teaching. The author examined 49 papers in google scholar citing GAP Version 4.7.5, 2014. After eliminating a number of items, such as duplicates or slides, the remaining 37 were subsumed under the following main groupings: explicit computation as part of a proof; examples and counter-examples; new algorithms; computation with explicit primes; applications in other fields; other. The author, in the end, draws some interesting conclusions: conjectures, concepts and examples play a key role in the creation of a proof; examples are used in a great variety of ways; leadership plays an important role in recruiting and channelling the labour of the crowd; and, finally, innovation is deeply affected by institutional factors."

From its official announcement the problem was solved within 74 minutes. The authors developed a typology of comments: concept, example, conjecture, proof, and other. By analyzing the various threads of attempted proof that developed until the final solution of the problem, they found that their analyses enriched the Polya and Lakatos's heuristic theoretical approaches. In the final section of the paper the authors propose to take into serious consideration the Turing test: if we want to develop machines that participate in an online polymath project and give off a sense of being human, we should should start analyzing automated proof in the same way as the typology of comments found in the polymath and mini-polymath projects."

Social machines where first formulated by Berners-Lee who envisioned human creativity assisted by machines taking up the administrative part. The main examples cited in the case of mathematics are \textit{polymath}, and \textit{mathoverflow}. Polymath is an online project, in which a difficult mathematical problem is proposed online, and anyone with some good enough mathematical background can post suggested solutions, or improvements of suggested solutions. Mathoverflow, on the other hand, is an online platform where one can post questions, and receive answers from other members.The postings are considered as evidence of informal processes in a mathematical proof which are, in general, difficult to document in normal circumstances. Each posting then is analyzed based on Polya's and Lakatos's theories of mathematical proof. Mathoverflow deals with existing concepts in mathematics, and the questions posted were identified to be mainly of three types: conjectures, what-is-this questions, and examples. Polymath, on the other hand, deals with open conjectures. Then the authors focus on \textit{minipolymaths} polymaths proposed in Olympiads which deal with solving problems deemed solvable with no need to use advanced mathematics. The main activity in one mini-polymath was classified into five categories: example, conjecture, proof, concept, other. Then the paper briefly examines other aspects of polymath and overflow, such as the presentation interface, or reputation ratings among the users. Finally the authors connect online collaborative projects of mathematics with the more broader context of social machines, mentioning, among others, design of social computations, accountability, provenance and trust, and others."

They were both active as professional mathematicians, both in teaching classes in the university, being presidents in the London Mathematical Society, as well as organising meetings among mathematicians. They both viewed collaboration as something important in their professional lives, especially Hardy whose published special articles on collaboration and teaching. Then the paper explains their collaboration in more detail, describing the practicalities of the matter such as paper sheets to write, or rules of answering to suggested solutions. Then the authors narrate the start of the polymath project. Tim Gowers in January after an initial blog question on the possibility of collaborative mathematics, started officially the polymath project by posting a problem. After 7 weeks the problem was solved and the result was published in a journal. By 2015 nine polymaths were completed and mini-polymaths for mathematical Olympiads were organised in the same spirit. The authors focused their attention on polymath8, which was split itno polymath8a and polymath 8b. Both polymath8a and polymath8b were published in the arXiv files. One concern for the organisers was to attract people and not intimidate them by expanding too much the scope of the project. There was a shared enthusiasm. A problem that arose was that of the participants' time commitment, as well as the pace of progress which was too fast for some. This is considered in the paper as a special case of crowdsourcing, with the crowd being rather specialized in the sense that they had to know mathematics of a more advanced level."

NRC scientists, in particular, adopted tablet PCs and generic, commercial, off-the-shelf software for note taking and turned them into ELNs. By closely following scientists' activities, the authors analyzed the use of ELNs for conducting experiments, processing data, sharing insights, and coordinating work. It was found that the flexibility of digital media enables personalization and optimal support for needs of individual scientists while the conformity and consistency in the scientific record increases the capacity for sharing and leveraging each other's work. Additionally, most of the requirements related to interlinking, structuring, and aggregation of data, accessing and sharing of content, browsing, and history search were achieved through the adopted ELN."

It studies a theorem in logic, Elkan's theorem, that was first presented in a context of strong competition between proponents of various approaches to artificial intelligence. Representations of Elkan's theorem were primarily constituted during interactions between readers and texts. The readings it did receive were often rapid and partial, when they existed at all. According to the author, simple agreement on the question of the correctness of Elkan's proof was particularly difficult to obtain because his texts were not read in the same way, despite the use of shared symbolic language. The fact that some of the debates took place in an electronic forum certainly contributed to this interplay. The author bases his assertions on ethnographic observations, interviews, and textual analysis."

In the author's opinion this dual nature of public statistics breaks down the dividing lines between producers and users of scientific knowledge. On one hand, producers of knowledge are being evaluated more closely by the worthiness of the products they provide, and travel through the whole chain of translations, from data production to product dissemination. On the other hand, the informed user is much more able to revise and reorganise the information he receives for his personal use than in the past. The author agues, in addition, that the statistical offices must also be able to travel in the opposite direction in the translation process, from products to production, making more open and explicit the technical and methodological choices that are part of the daily life of any research institution. The role of the translator, that arises as a result, is not to make sure that everybody uses the term in the same way the statistician does, but to build bridges and help each to understand the way the word is used by others."

The history of the classification proof spans more than three decades, it involved more than a hundred mathematicians, and when the theorem was officially declared proved there had been already published around 200 to 500 research articles. The author promotes the idea that making sense in a community of practitioners is embedded in that particular community and cannot be separated from a wider body of literature this community has produced. She suggests that a mathematical proof is a collective effort during which every participant has an individual, and local, view of the proof but no participant has has an all-encompassing, and global, perspective of the whole project. Moreover she traces the history of the classification theorem in the social and political context of 20th century US history."

Perceive quality of contributions by a user was measured by the rated quality of his or her answers and questions by other users. Four measures of reputation were used: \textit{offline reputation} measured by the number of publications each contributor had; \textit{MathOverflow points}, that is, the rating a contributor received based on the past votes by other contributors; \textit{authoritativenes}, based on the confidence a contributor answered a question; \textit{social connectedness}, found by network analysis of past questions and answers. In general, a low to moderate correlation was found among these measures of reputations, and the authors conclude that these most probably are different types of reputation. The strongest predictors of perceived quality were offline reputation and MathOverflow points. The final aim of this paper was how to optimize the emphasis on reputation."

This inventory was taken from previous studies. Using statistical analysis the authors found that getting information, reputation building, and relationship development were strongly correlated, while self discovery was found to be irrelevant to the MathOverflow community. They explain this high correlation by observing that the first three motivators are necessary components in a professional mathematician's career. Moreover, reputation building, in particular, was found to encourage contributions to the MathOverflow community."

According to the authors, biology is becoming ``Big Biology:'' its original disciplinary goal is turning from description and classification to determination of biological function. The paper draws on a large collaborative e-Science project, the Integrative Biology (IB) project, an international consortium of seven universities and one research institution with a mix of both theoretical and experimental groups who are collaborating at different levels, and who are drawn from a very wide range of disciplines (including computer science, mathematics, medical and software engineering, biophysics, biochemistry, physiology, genetics, molecular biology and several areas of clinical medicine). The primary aim of the IB project is the development of the IT or Grid infrastructure to support the entire research process, and to develop a virtual research environment, based on state-of-the-art Grid technologies. This paper seems to be more theoretical, rather, than empirical, and proposes, as part of a future research agenda, the conduct of more ethnographic research on ``Big Science.''"
